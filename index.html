      <h2>“Very High” Accuracy – Machine Learning Helps Separate Compostable From Conventional Plastic Waste</h2>
      <p>The use of compostable plastics is increasing, and while they offer several benefits, these materials, such as wrappers and packaging, can mix with and contaminate traditional plastic waste during recycling. To address this issue, scientists have employed advanced imaging techniques and created machine-learning algorithms capable of distinguishing compostable plastics from conventional ones.
        <br/><br/>Disposable plastics are everywhere in our lives, appearing in various forms such as food containers, coffee cups, and plastic bags. Although certain plastics are designed to biodegrade under controlled conditions, they are still problematic as they often resemble traditional plastics. When these compostable plastics are recycled improperly, they can contaminate plastic waste streams, leading to a reduction in recycling efficiency. Furthermore, recyclable plastics are often mistaken for compostable ones, resulting in polluted compost</p>

      <h2>New “Biohybrid” Neural Implant Could Restore Function in Paralyzed Limbs</h2>
      <p>Researchers have developed a new type of neural implant that could restore limb function to amputees and others who have lost the use of their arms or legs.
        In a study carried out in rats, researchers from the University of Cambridge used the device to improve the connection between the brain and paralyzed limbs. The device combines flexible electronics and human stem cells – the body’s ‘reprogrammable’ master cells – to better integrate with the nerve and drive limb function.
        <br/><br/>The researchers say that by combining two advanced therapies for nerve regeneration – cell therapy and bioelectronics – into a single device, they can overcome the shortcomings of both approaches, improving functionality and sensitivity.
        <br/><br/>While extensive research and testing will be needed before it can be used in humans, the device is a promising development for amputees or those who have lost function of a limb or limbs. The results were reported on March 22, 2023, in the journal Science Advances.</p>

      <h2>“Smart” Bandages: A Cheaper, Easier, and More Effective Way To Treat Chronic Wounds</h2>
      <p>In general, the body’s natural healing process can effectively handle cuts, scrapes, burns, and other types of wounds. However, for individuals with diabetes, this may not always be the case. The condition can impair the healing process and result in persistent wounds that are susceptible to infection and may worsen over time.
        <br/><br/>Chronic wounds not only cause significant physical and emotional distress for those affected, but they also place a significant financial burden on healthcare systems. In the United States alone, the cost of treating these wounds amounts to an estimated $25 billion annually.        
        <br/><br/>A new kind of smart bandage developed at Caltech may make treatment of these wounds easier, more effective, and less expensive. These smart bandages were developed in the lab of Wei Gao, assistant professor of medical engineering, Heritage Medical Research Institute Investigator, and Ronald and JoAnne Willens Scholar.
